Description: PESCO stands for "Post-processing and Evaluation
             with Statistical methods of a Chemistry-transport-model
             Output". The package provides functions to perform data
             fusion for air quality data, correcting the output of a
             deterministic CTM with observed data, with a Trans-Gaussian
             Kriging approach.
