\arguments{
  \item{x}{
vector of the concentration values
}
  \item{period}{
vector, with the same length as \code{x}, to distinguish different periods (e.g. days, months)
}
  \item{window}{
numerical vectors with two elements; defines the running window, e.g. \code{c(-7,0)} is the 8 hours window for 8hr running mean of ozone or carbon monoxide
}
  \item{necess}{
number of data needed in each time period
}
  \item{nmax.missing}{
number of missing data accepted in each time period
}
  \item{FUN}{
the function to be applied
}
  \item{threshold}{
threshold
}
  \item{k}{
in \code{shift}, the number of timesteps you want to shift \code{x}; in \code{mean.window}, the width of the window
}
  \item{hr}{numerical vector of the hours (with the same length as \code{x})}
  \item{threshold}{threshold}
  \item{estimate}{logical. IF \code{TRUE} the AOT is corrected according to the EU legislation in order to take into account the number of missing values}
  \item{hr.min}{first hour of the timerange over which AOT is calculated}
  \item{hr.max}{last hour of the timerange over which AOT is calculated}
}
\details{
The functions \code{stat.period} and \code{stat.period2} apply the function \code{FUN} over defined time periods, with different approaches in handling missing data. The function \code{which.period} is similar to \code{stat.period}, but you can use it for functions (such as \code{which.min} or \code{which.max} ) which do not accept the argument \code{na.rm}.

Instead \code{stat.window}  operates on a floating window, and calls \code{shift}  that moves the time series forward or backward in time. The function \code{mean.window} do the same and is more efficient, but limited to the moving average.

The function \code{exc.period}  counts exceedances of a given threshold.
Instead \code{detect.event}  returns an array containing the date and time of the exceedances and their duration (expressed in number of timestep).

\code{aot} calculates Accumulated exposure Over Threshold
